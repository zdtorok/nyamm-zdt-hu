# **Version 1.0**
### `May 7, 2021`
First version of the application.

Your new digital recipe book has just arrived! It's an easy-to-use but still powerful tool to help you keep all your recipes in one safe place across all your devices.

Do you have a grill party and your friends envy your excellent Steak? Send your recipe with one touch with Nyamm and amaze your friends!

Do you have multiple devices? iPad, iPhone? No problem, with Nyamm all your recipes will be synced across your devices automatically.

Do you still prefer to have your recipes also printed? Not a problem either! You can create your own recipe book in PDF whenever you want, so you can print it later!

Enjoy all the following features:
- organize your recipes into food groups
- store a useful link to a website/video for your recipes, so you can get there with one touch
- amaze yourself with beautiful photos - add your own photo for your recipes and food groups
- send your recipe to a friend instantly, so they can save it in their Nyamm immediately
- export your recipe(s) in PDF so you can share or print later
- save a servings size for your recipes, so by changing that, Nyamm will automatically update the needed ingredients
